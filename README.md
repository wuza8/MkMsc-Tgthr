# MkMsc-Together
Music making software for people, who want to own their music entirely, have great sound quality without paying a penny for a thing that is their hobby. 

This is the first commit on this repository, if you somehow came here, you can follow the repo for next updates on the project.

This project has a couple of non-functional requirements to accomplish:

1. UI should be comparably good to today's music making software like FL Studio and some other online music editors like soundtrap.
2. You should be able to create a music making session and add your friends to participate in doing the music.
3. Project should have its own synthesizer.
4. The majority of code should be wrote on Rust.
5. If possible, connections between users should be peer-to-peer.

At this moment, the project would focus on presenting a plan of implementation, UI view and so on updated each week on friday.
